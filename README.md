# auth-service
API for User management and security (using JWT)


## Certification key

The key was generated by using next command:
`keytool -genkeypair -alias testkey -keyalg RSA -dname "CN=jwt,OU=jtw,O=jtw,L=zurich,S=zurich,C=CH" -keypass secret -keystore sample.jks -storepass secret`

For security reasons is better to generate your own key file for your environment.


To export public key use:
`keytool -list -rfc --keystore jwt-test.jks | openssl x509 -inform pem -pubkey`
Copy public key part only into file: `public.cert`
